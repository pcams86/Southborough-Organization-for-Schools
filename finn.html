        <h2>About Finn SOS</h2>
        <p>
          The Southborough Organization for Schools (SOS) is our parent teacher organization. SOS is a 501 (c)3 non profitable organization of parent volunteers committed to working with our school teachers and administrators to enhance the learning experience of our children. Each Southborough School has its own dedicated SOS team. At Finn, SOS supports school related initiatives from school community events to backpack name tags to classroom grants and teacher appreciation to field trips to cultural arts and curriculum enrichment programming.

    <h2>WHY GET INVOLVED</h2>
    <p>
      Volunteers are an important part of Mary Finn School! Parent involvement is a powerful tool and can make a dramatic difference for your children and school. Our school relies on volunteers to help with events, assist in classrooms, help out at lunch and in the library, and plan curriculum enrichment activities. There are opportunities for everyone from recurring roles to helping when you can!

          <h2>ABOUT THE FUNDRAISER</h2>
          <p>
            The volleyball marathon is Trottier's largest fundraiser. This fun,
            whole school event will run all day on Friday, April 5th. During the
            school hours, teachers bring their classes to the gym to play
            volleyball.
          </p>
          <p>
            All students will have an opportunity to participate during the
            school day. The fun then continues after school with the option for
            students to Stay and Play from 2:30-6pm.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order for students to stay after school, a minimum donation of
            $15 is required. (paid via their student's individual fundraising
            page - register now by clicking on the blue link) We are hoping,
            however, that each student can raise a minimum of $50 to make our
            fundraiser a great success.
          </p>
          <p>
            There will be cash concessions offering students pizza ($2), drinks
            and snacks ($1) during the after school hours.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trottier Middle School understands the need to promote a healthy and
            educational fundraiser to our students while respecting parents'
            repeated requests for an easy no-nonsense approach to helping us
            reach our budget goals. Please keep in mind that this is Trottier's
            most significant fundraiser and the money raised will support the
            students and teachers directly (see pie chart below). So please
            consider donating in order to support your student's educational
            experience.

          <h1>VOLUNTEER OPORTUNITIES</h1>
          <p>
            Southborough Organization for Schools (SOS) is looking for
            volunteers for the 2024-25 school year. SOS is Southborough School
            District’s parent teacher organization (PTO). SOS is a 501(c)3
            non-profit organization that comprises parent volunteers committed
            to working with our school teachers and administrators to enhance
            the learning experience of our children.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each school has its own SOS committee composed of co-chairs and a
            treasurer which plans school wide events and meets directly with the
            school principal to support the school. The General SOS has a
            committee consisting of a president, vice president, secretary and
            treasurer which maintains our non-profit status and provides
            consistency and support amongst the schools’ SOS committees.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a great and fun opportunity to get involved by giving back
            to your schools while directly supporting your child(ren). All
            positions have been documented well allowing for easy transitions
            and all the committees work together to support each other.

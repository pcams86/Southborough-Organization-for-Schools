          <h2>DONATIONS</h2>
          <p>
            Do you want to donate to SOS? Choose whatever option fits you
            best!<br />
          </p>
          <h3>Direct Payments</h3>
          <p>
            <a
              href="https://venmo.com/code?user_id=3369902207401984832&created=1689076747.344341&printed=1"

          </p>
          <h3>Fundrasing</h3>
          <p>
            There are several ways, in addition to donations, that parents can
            help fund raise for SOS.
          </p>
          <h3>Box Tops for Education</h3>
          <p>
            Use the Box Tops app to scan your store receipts for participating
            products. Your school will automatically earn cash with every Box
            Tops product you buy. Simply download the app, select your school,
            scan your receipt with your phone and the the items are immediately
            identified and the money is dropped in the school box tops account.
            It takes 3 seconds to scan a receipt.
          </p>
          <h3>School Portraits</h3>
          <p>
            SOS receives a portion of every school portrait purchase. When you
            purchase a school portrait, you not only receive a memory of that
            school year, but you are supporting SOS and fundraising efforts for
            your child's school. School pictures are usually taken and purchased
            in the fall.
          </p>
          <h3>School Supply Kits for Finn, Woodward, and Trottier</h3>
          <p>
            SOS receives a portion of every school supply kit that is purchased.
            Purchasing a school supply kit makes back-to-school shopping easy
            and ensures that you purchase the items requested by your child's
            teacher. Supply kits are ordered in May and will be delivered to
            your child's classroom before the first day of school.
          </p>
          <h3>Textile Recycling</h3>
          <p>
            Recycle your old clothes, linens, and more and the Southborough SOS
            can earn money - at no cost to you! Look for large white donation
            bins in the parking lot at each school in Southborough. The bins are
            accessible at all times and are emptied weekly. SOS gets paid by the
            pound so the more you donate, the more money we make! In 2021, we
            collected 12,345 pounds of textiles for reuse and recycling.
            Baystate Textiles collects used clothing and other textiles
            including stuffted animals, pillows, shoes, linens with holes and
            stains and more. A complete list of acceptable items can be found
            here:

            meetings are from 10-11:30am. We may try to condense these meetings
            into 1 hour, if possible. We will send calendar invites prior to
            each meeting.

      <h2>About Woodward SOS</h2>
      <p>
        The Southborough Organization for Schools (SOS) is our parent teacher
        organization. SOS is a 501 (c)3 non profitable organization of parent
        volunteers committed to working with our school teachers and
        administrators to enhance the learning experience of our children. Each
        Southborough school has its own dedicated SOS team. At Woodward, SOS
        supports school related initiatives such as school community events,
        teacher grants, teacher appreciation, field trips, and cultural arts and
        curriculum enrichment programming.

      <h2>WHY GET INVOLVED</h2>
      <p>
        Volunteers are an important part of Woodward School! Parent involvement
        is a powerful tool and can make a dramatic difference for your children
        and school. Our school relies on volunteers to help with events, assist
        in classrooms, help out in the library, and plan curriculum enrichment
        and fundraising events. There are opportunities for everyone from
        recurring roles to helping when you can!

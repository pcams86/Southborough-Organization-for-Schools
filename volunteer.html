          <h1>VOLUNTEER OPORTUNITIES</h1>
          <p>
            Southborough Organization for Schools (SOS) is looking for
            volunteers for the 2024-25 school year. SOS is Southborough School
            District's parent teacher organization (PTO). SOS is a 501(c)3
            non-profit organization that comprises parent volunteers committed
            to working with our school teachers and administrators to enhance
            the learning experience of our children.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each school has its own SOS committee composed of co-chairs and a
            treasurer which plans school wide events and meets directly with the
            school principal to support the school. The General SOS has a
            committee consisting of a president, vice president, secretary and
            treasurer which maintains our non-profit status and provides
            consistency and support amongst the schools' SOS committees.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a great and fun opportunity to get involved by giving back
            to your schools while directly supporting your child(ren). All
            positions have been documented well allowing for easy transitions
            and all the committees work together to support each other.

          <p>
            The responsibilities of the Co-Chair include supporting the Chair in
            planning the monthly meetings which are at 8:30 on the first Friday
            of each month during the school year, creating the agenda, and
            soliciting volunteers for each committee. Time requirement is on
            average 2-4 hours per month. Based on SOS events at Trottier, April,
            May, and June are the busiest months. If the position of secretary
            is not filled, the co-chair would need to fill those
            responsibilities.

          <h4 class="trottier-color">Treasurer:</h4>
          <p>
            The responsibilities of the Treasurer include developing annual
            budget, reconciling monthly reports and providing a status to the
            team monthly. The Treasurer is also accountable for all deposits and
            check requests. Attend monthly meetings which are at 8:30 on the
            first Friday of each month during the school year. He/she will
            provide financial guidance as spending decisions arise throughout
            the year. There should be a basic working knowledge of Excel. Time
            requirement is on average 2-4 hours per month. Based on SOS events
            at Trottier, April, May, and June are the busiest months.
          </p>
          <h4 class="trottier-color">Assistant Treasurer:</h4>
          <p>
            Assist Treasurer by making deposits at bank and attending monthly
            meetings which are at 8:30 on the first Friday of each month during
            the school year (attendance optional). There should be a basic
            working knowledge of Excel. Time requirement is on average 2-4 hours
            per month. Based on SOS events at Trottier, April, May, and June are
            the busiest months. The hope would be that the Asst. Treasurer, also
            learns about the budget and reconciling reports from overall SOS
            Treasurer so that they can assume the role of Treasurer the
            following year. This allows for a smooth transition.
